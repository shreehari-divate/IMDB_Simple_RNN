# IMDB Simple RNN
Classifying movie reviews as positive or negative using a Simple RNN model for sentiment analysis on the IMDb dataset

This project uses IMDB dataset from keras library to classify the movie review as positive or neagtive using Simple Rnn.
Keras Tuner is been used to optimize the performance of the model by selecting the best hyperparameters.
Once the model is trained, prediction is performed based on user input which classifies the review as positive or negative based on threshold value 0.5
